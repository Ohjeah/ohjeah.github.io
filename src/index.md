Hi, I'm **Markus Quade**.

My research is focussed on symbolic regression and its application to dynamical systems for time series prediction, system identification and control. More broadly I am interested in complex systems and stochastic processes. 

I am working as a CTO at [Ambrosys](www.ambrosys.de). Our work is focussed on software development, system design as well as consulting with topics ranging from machine learning, mobility, and energy to complex systems and MLOps. We are involved in many research activities related to data science, in particular we push on artificial intelligence and develop our own tools to speed up development and raise quality.

If you want to get in touch just send me an [<i class="far fa-envelope" aria-hidden="true"></i>](mailto:{{ site.author.email }}).
