Hello and welcome to my little corner in the internet. After creating small websites for other projects and experimenting with various static site generators I ended up using [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) for my personal one. [Gh-pages](https://pages.github.com/) and the [vast amound of free jekyll themes](http://jekyllthemes.org/) allow you to create your initial draft in minutes without the need to install jekyll at all.

This is my own interpretation of [Heiswayi Nrirds minimal **thinkspace** theme](http://heiswayi.github.io/thinkspace/). Along the way I also had some help by [Matthieu Caneill](http://matthieu.io/)  implementing the [jekyll-scholar pluging](https://github.com/inukshuk/jekyll-scholar). Thank you Matthieu.
